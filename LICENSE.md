# Predicting Price of Flight Tickets

This repository contains the code and resources for a Machine Learning project aimed at predicting the price of flight tickets based on various features. The project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook for implementation and includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and the development of predictive models.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights into the dataset's structure, missing values, correlations, and feature distributions.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Statistical testing to validate assumptions and identify significant features.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of regression models to predict flight prices.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Metrics like RMSE, R-squared, and MAE to evaluate model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to flights, such as:
- Date of journey
- Airline
- Source and destination
- Duration
- Total stops
- Additional information

Ensure the dataset is available in the appropriate directory before running the notebook.

## Requirements

To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- 
## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading:** Load and explore the dataset.
2. **EDA:** Visualize and analyze features to understand their impact on the target variable.
3. **Preprocessing:** Prepare the data by handling missing values, encoding, and scaling.
4. **Hypothesis Testing:** Perform statistical tests to validate assumptions and identify significant features.
5. **Model Development:** Train regression models to predict flight prices.
6. **Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Results

The project demonstrates the ability to predict flight ticket prices with reasonable accuracy. Detailed results and insights can be found in the notebook.
